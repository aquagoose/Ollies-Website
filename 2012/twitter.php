<!--    Ollie's Website 2012 RECREATION
        Recreated from scratch with my only source being the
        blurriest picture in the world. Far as I'm aware it's
        the only surviving image of this page.

                <p>
                    There's not a twitter page here. This is the only page where the contents of it are completely
                    unknown. It's a shame really, but oh well. I'm hoping I can find a backup of the website <i>somewhere</i>
                    but it's looking unlikely.<br />While we're here, why not take a look into what I used to completely
                    recreate this website from scratch!

                    <h3>index.php</h3>
                    To recreate this, I used the following resources:<br />
                    - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140517164327/http://ollierobinson.co.uk/">May 17th 2014 capture from the Web Archive.</a><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>This was used to get the text and a basis of the original source code.</i><br />
                    - <a href="https://youtu.be/ZmNYzwHC3NU?t=192">3:12 at an old video "My Favourite Devices Part 4"</a><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>This was used to get the original structure of the website correct.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>windows8.php</h3>
                    - <a href="https://youtu.be/ZmNYzwHC3NU?t=203">3:23 at an old video "My Favourite Devices Part 4"</a><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>This was used to get the structure of the page.</i><br />
                    - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WByD4PlH14A">"Quick Tips About Windows 8"</a><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>This was used to get all the text from the page.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>photo.php</h3>
                    - <a href="https://youtu.be/ZmNYzwHC3NU?t=260">4:20 at an old video "My Favourite Devices Part 4"</a><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>This was used to get the layout of the page. The rest of it was done with PHP and interpretation.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>The Rest</h3>
                    All of the other pages were recovered using this single video as a reference:<br />
                    - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu4fW64tFZI">Sony Tablet S Video</a><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Despite this video being 480p, and filmed on the blurriest camera in the world,
                                                I still managed to work out most of what was written on these pages.
                                                Sadly the bottom half of the "electrical" page has been lost.</i>
